Version 2.0.4
- Added options to reposition the Ticket Status frame.
- Added options to show/hide the vehicle seats.
- Fixed the border changing to white when enabling/disabling Rotating Minimap.
- Fixed compass rotating the wrong way round.
- Tweak the Expander module to shrink the player arrow (fixes ticket #3).
- Load libraries and modules from the .toc.
- The "Profiles" section now appears at the bottom of the modules list instead of in the middle of it.
- Set the width of the "Enable" option to "full" to force other options onto a new line (which looks nicer imo).

Version 2.0.3
- Remove all references to the Watch Frame, since the user can move and resize it manually.

Version 2.0.2
- Fix another bug, this one involving broken concatenations.

Version 2.0.1
- Fix a bug in the MoveButtons module.

Version 2.0
- Completely re-written, now using Ace-3.0 instead of LibRock. Your SavedVariables will be reset as a result. Sorry.
